# Chargrid: Towards Understanding 2D Documents
------
  When we want to do *document understanding* with *deep learning*, the first thing that comes to our mind is to handle it as NLP task. However suddenly, the problem appears. Document understanding is usually 2-dimensional task, different from NLP which solves problem usually in 1-dimensional way. In this paper, they made a **GRID** which can contain not only 1D information. but also 2D ones.
